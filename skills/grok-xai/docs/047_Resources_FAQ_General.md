xAI will send an email to you when someone logs into your xAI account. The login location is an approximation based on your IP address, which is dependent on your network setup and ISP and might not reflect exactly where the login happened.

If you think the login is not you, please [reset your password](https://accounts.x.ai/request-reset-password) and [clear your login sessions](https://accounts.x.ai/sessions). We also recommend all users to [add a multi-factor authentication method](https://accounts.x.ai/security).
